# AEMaaCS Postman Collection
(Hopefully) growing Postman Collection for various AEM operations.

The Postman collection is a starting point for AEM developers and consultants. It should help you during, setup, migration, debugging and hotfixes.
All commands were tested in AEM as a Cloud Service.

Together with the [Postman Runner](https://blog.postman.com/using-csv-and-json-files-in-the-postman-collection-runner/) its also a valid bulk edit/migration tool.


## Why
There are several reasons why i created the repo. 
* Since CRXDE Lite is blocked in AEMaaCS its sometimes tough to do certain "stuff". Like quickly edit a property or delete a "nasty" node. Normally i use the [AEMaaCS Repo Browser](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developer-tools/repository-browser.html?lang=en) to find the culprit, then do the necessary changes via the collection.
* Create custom packages (eg. use the aem querybuilder to find the needed assets for the package and use that payload to create the custom package.)
* Mass creation of pages for eg. migration support with the help of the postman runner
* Upload of assets (Also a valid runner (See "Runner Tasks" below) task if you want to upload multiple assets)
* Mass change of user groups (Also a valid runner task)

## How to use
* Create a classic (non IMS user) [within AEM](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-64/forms/administrator-help/setup-organize-users/adding-configuring-users.html?lang=en). I might add IMS support in the future.
* Install the collection
* Setup a new [Postman Environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/). The "Path" Variable is optional and only used for Postman Runner Tasks. It should look like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4376185/199006197-7d3a489c-6264-4308-b1f2-e2d62d030a7d.png)
* Set the Environment 
* Have Fun

## Runner Tasks
As stated above the [Postman Runner](https://blog.postman.com/using-csv-and-json-files-in-the-postman-collection-runner/) is a valid tool for bulk/mass operations. Attached is a video of what I once did for content fragments (to create them in bulk based on a .csv). You don't see the AEM Collection in the video, but the logic is exactly the same. The variable settings in minute 0:30 are best not as seen in the video but set up in the environment.
